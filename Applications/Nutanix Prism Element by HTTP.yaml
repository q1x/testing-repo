    template: Nutanix Prism Element by HTTP
    name: Nutanix Prism Element by HTTP
    description: |
      Prism Element: It is a service already built into the platform for every Nutanix cluster deployed. It provides the ability to fully configure, manage, and monitor Nutanix clusters running any hypervisors, however, it only manages the cluster it is part of.

      This template is designed for the effortless deployment of Nutanix Prism Element monitoring and doesn't require any external scripts.

      The templates "Nutanix Host Prism Element by HTTP" and "Nutanix Cluster Prism Element by HTTP" can be used in discovery, as well as manually linked to a host.
