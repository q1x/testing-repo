    template: Nutanix Host Prism Element by HTTP
    name: Nutanix Host Prism Element by HTTP
    description: |
      Prism Element: It is a service already built into the platform for every Nutanix cluster deployed. It provides the ability to fully configure, manage, and monitor Nutanix clusters running any hypervisors, however, It only manages the cluster it is part of.

      This template is designed for the effortless deployment of Nutanix Host Prism Element monitoring and doesn't require any external scripts.

      This template can be used in discovery, as well as manually linked to a host - to do so, attach it to the host and manually set the value of the '{$NUTANIX.HOST.UUID}' macro.

      More details can be found in the official documentation:
        - on retrieving UUIDs: https://www.nutanixbible.com/19b-cli.html
        - on the Nutanix Prism Element REST API: https://www.nutanix.dev/api_reference/apis/prism_v2.html
