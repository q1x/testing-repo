    description: |
      Template for monitoring servers with BMC over IPMI that work without any external scripts.
      All metrics are collected at once, thanks to Zabbix's bulk data collection. The template is available starting from Zabbix version 5.0.
      It collects metrics by polling BMC remotely using an IPMI agent.


      Known Issues:

        Description: If the BMC has a sensor with an empty threshold value, we get the LLD error "Cannot create trigger...".
